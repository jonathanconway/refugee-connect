# Refugee Connect

An interface design project aimed at assisting refugee and asylum seeker
arrivals coming to Australia for the first time. Through a human-centred and
iterative design approach, coupled with scholarly research, a resource directory
was proposed, which connects those in need to people, communities and resources
that can help them.

This high-fidelity prototype was built iteratively, based on regular feedback
from usability testing.
